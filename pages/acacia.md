## Introduction

The multi-access key to the _Acacia_ of Victoria is a key to all 146 taxa that are known to occur in Victoria, both native and introduced, based on the Australia-wide WATTLE key v. 2.1 (Maslin, B.R, coordinator, 2018). It contains 59 characters to help distinguish taxa from each other with, including place of occurrence, growth form, and several morphological features both vegetative and reproductive.<!--more--> It differs from the dichotomous keys provided in VicFlora by giving the user the flexibility to choose from one of the 59 characters provided rather than the user having to commit to investigate the particular features being questioned in the dichotomous keys. This has the benefit of:

1. avoiding having to answer questions relating to a feature that may not be present in the sample when being identified,

2. potentially being able to identify a taxon without needing to comprehend the most technical terminology and

3. allowing the rapid identification of taxa with distinct features rarely encountered in the genus

To use the key the user selects a feature from the features in the top left Features Available panel and clicks on the state present in their specimen to be identified. Once selected this feature and state will show as being selected in the Features Chosen panel directly below the Features Available panel. To undo a selection, click on the box next to the state chosen in the Features Chosen panel to erase the tick in the box. Once a feature state is chosen all the taxa that do not possess the chosen feature state are discarded in the bottom right Entities Discarded panel and those that do possess the chosen feature state are retained in the top right Entities Remaining panel. The user continues to choose further character states present in their specimen until identification is achieved. To restart the key when finished select the restart key icon represented by the two green arrows in the top left corner of the screen.

## General helpful hints

For the most effective use of this key the user is encouraged to read the help guides for each character and state before submitting an answer for that character and state. Help guides and photographs can be found by clicking on the page icons beside characters and states. This help will reduce the chance of misinterpretation of the character and state. Some information and definitions required for interpreting a state may be given under character so users are encouraged to read the help guide for the characters before the states. When taking measurements or assessing which state a character exists in for the taxon being identified a typical plant and plant part should be used. Typical is here interpreted as a close representation of the average plant in terms of size and stature in a population and a plant part that represents the average condition for that character (e.g. average length, the most frequently observed shape etc.). Characters provided concern the adult plant and consequently the plant chosen should be reproductively mature. For some of the characters it is possible for some taxa to possess more than one character state for the character. In such cases either correct character state can be chosen. When taking measurements be precise e.g. if a pod is 4.9 mm wide enter 4.9 mm wide rather than rounding up to 5 mm and entering that.

To help identify the specimen to be identified as quickly as possible the best option can be used. This option highlights which characters should be used first to discard the maximum number of taxa among the remaining taxa. To use the best option select the best icon given as a blue wand at the top of the screen. For some similar taxa such as closely related species or subspecies within a species it may become time consuming to keep using the key until one taxon remains. In such instances the user can use the dichotomous key and profiles to help distinguish between the remaining similar species.

## Growth Form

This character refers to the overall form of the plant and comprises three states.

### Tree

In this state the plant is more than three metres tall and has a single trunk.

### Erect Shrub

In this state the plant is less than three metres tall, grows upright and typically has several similar sized stems rather than a single large trunk.

### Prostrate shrub

In this state the plant grows close to ground level with the main stems and branches usually lying flat on the ground.

## Branchlet pruinosity

This character refers to whether there is a white powdery coating (bloom) on the branchlets or not.

### Pruinose

In this state the branchlets have a white powdery coating (bloom) on their surface that can be easily removed by rubbing a finger along the branchlet.

### Not pruinose

In this state there is a complete absence of a white powdery coating (bloom) on the surface of the branchlet.

## Branchlet hairs (presence)

This character refers to whether there are hairs on branchlets or not.

### Branchlet hairs present

In this state hairs that may be short or long, spreading or appressed, or sparse to dense, will be present on young, but mature branchlets. Hairs may become lost in older branchlets and so young branchlets should be inspected to avoid misidentification.

### Branchlet hairs absent

In this state there is a complete absence of hairs on young, but mature branchlets.

## Branchlet hairs (orientation)

This character refers to the direction that the hairs on young, but mature branchlets are orientated relative to the branchlet surface and comprises three characters.

### Appressed

In this state the hairs lie flat against the surface of the branchlet or do not form an angle of more than 15 degrees with the branchlet.

### Sub-appressed

In this state the hairs form an angle between 15 and 75 degrees with the surface of the branchlet.

### Widely spreading

In this state the hairs spread mostly at right-angles to the branchlet surface or at least at an angle greater than 75 degrees.

## Branchlet tip pungency

This character refers to whether the ends of the mature branchlets form sharp points or not. Ignore actively growing new shoots, which may not have developed their rigidity.

### Pungent

In this state the tips of the branchlets end in a hard, rigid and sharp point that can be painful to press down on.

### Not pungent

In this state the tips of the branchlets are neither hardened nor sharp-pointed.

## Stipule pungency

This character refers to whether the two appendages (stipules) at the base of the leaf or phyllode form sharp spines or not.

### Stipule pungent

In this state the two appendages (stipules) at the base of the leaf or phyllode are rigid, terete and narrowed to a sharp point that can be painful to press down on.

### Stipule not pungent

In this state the two appendages (stipules) at the base of the leaf or phyllode are variable in form and size, but are often papery or membranous and may be caducous (i.e. drop off early). They are never rigid and sharp-pointed.

## Foliage Type

This character refers to the form of the mature foliage and comprises three states.

### Bipinnate

In the state the leaves are divided so that there is a main central axis that gives rise to other lateral axes that bear the leaflets. Most _Acacia_ species have pinnate or bipinnate leaves when young. For species that produce phyllodes when mature select phyllodes for this character. In the rare instance that mature plants possess both phyllodes and bipinnate when mature then select phyllodes for this character.

### Phyllodes

In this state the mature foliage of the plant resembles simple undivided leaves. These structures called phyllodes are a flattened petiole (leaf stalk) and/or rachis that assumes the form and function of the leaf. In the rare instance that mature plants possess both phyllodes and bipinnate when mature then select phyllodes for this character.

### Leaves absent

In this state foliar structures are completely absent leaving only branchlets as the green structures. Among Victorian _Acacia_ this state is known only in _A. extensa_ and _A. spinescens_.

## Phyllode length

The length in mm of mature phyllodes from the site of attachment to the branchlet at the base to the tip. For curved phyllodes measure along the line of curvature rather than a straight line from the base to the tip. For very short phyllodes (i.e. less than about 5 mm long) it is especially important to measure accurately because an error of even 1 mm may result in misidentification.

## Phyllode width

The width in mm across the widest point of mature phyllodes. For very narrow phyllodes (i.e. less than about 5 mm wide) it is especially important to measure accurately because an error of even 1 mm may result in misidentification.

## Phyllode shape

This character refers to the shape of the outline of the phyllode and comprises six states. This character is not applicable to species with bipinnate leaves when mature.

### Linear

In this state the phyllode has more or less parallel margins and its length is more than nine times its width.

### Narrowly elliptic to orbicular

In this state the phyllodes have their widest point close to midway along the phyllode and their margins are curved. This state includes the shapes narrowly elliptic, elliptic, widely elliptic and orbicular. In some species with this character state the phyllode will be asymmetric.

### Narrowly oblong to oblong

In this state the phyllode is widest around midway along the phyllode and the margins are more or less parallel for much of their length. In some species with this character state the phyllode will be asymmetric.

### Lanceolate to ovate

In this state the phyllode is widest near the base and their margin are curved. In some species with this character state the phyllode will be asymmetric.

### Oblanceolate to obovate

In this state the phyllode is widest near the apex and their margins are curved. In some species with this character state the phyllode will be asymmetric.

### Triangular

In this state the phyllode has three prominent sides that may be of equal or unequal length, straight or curved, resembling a triangle. Commonly the triangular outline results from a pronounced gland-angle on the upper margin of the phyllode.

## Phyllode arrangement

This character refers to how the phyllodes are positioned on a mature stem relative to other phyllodes and comprises four states.

### Fasciculate

In this state more than one phyllode arises from the same point on the stem. On new growth the phyllodes are usually borne singly, the fascicles developing lower down on mature stems.

### Whorled

In this state multiple phyllodes arise from the same level on the stem encircling the stem.

### Scattered

In this state phyllodes are borne singly along the stem.

## Phyllode number (per whorl)

This character refers to the number of phyllodes in a single whorl for species that have their phyllodes arranged in a whorl.

## Phyllode colour

This character refers to the colour of mature fresh phyllodes. The color can change in dried specimens.

### Glaucous or grey

In this state the phyllodes are blue-green or grey due to a whitish bloom or hairs on the phyllode surface.

### Sub-glaucous to grey-green

In this state the phyllodes are intermediate between green and grey or glaucous.

### Green

In this state the phyllodes are various shades of green, including light, dark, yellowish or olive green.

## Phyllode hairs (presence)

This character refers to whether there are hairs on young, but mature phyllodes, or not. Hairs can be very sparse or dense, and minute to long.

### Phyllode hairs present

In this state there are hairs, either minute or long, on some part of the phyllode.

### Phyllode hairs absent

In this state there is a complete absent of hairs on the phyllode.

## Phyllode cross-section

This character refers to the shape of the face created when a mature phyllode is cut through transversely and comprises six states. This character is best used for fresh material. In dried specimens the true phyllode cross section can become obscured.

### Terete

In this state the cross-section is circular.

### Sub-terete

In this state the cross-section is almost circular but is slightly flattened horizontally or vertically.

### Compressed

In this state the cross-section is intermediate between flat and sub-terete. This term is applied to narrow, thick phyllodes that are difficult to classify as flat.

### Quadrangular

In this state the cross-section is square or rhombic and there is a nerve at the apex of each of the four angles.

### Pentagonal

In this state the cross-section is five-sided and there is a nerve at the apex of each of the five angles. This state is only known in _A. extensa_ among the Victorian _Acacia_.

### Flat

In this state the mature phyllodes have a negligible thickness compared to their width.

## Phyllode nerve number (non-flat phyllodes)

This character refers to the number of lines (both prominent and minor) that run lengthwise along the surface of the mature non-flat phyllodes and comprises five states. Nerves are commonly faint or obscured by hairs or resin. The nerves are often more pronounced in dried specimens than in fresh material and consequently this character is often easier to use for dried specimens. This character only applies to terete, sub-terete, quadrangular or pentagonal phyllodes. If phyllodes are flat or compressed use the character, Phyllode nerve number (flat or compressed phyllodes).

### Zero

In this state there are no nerves observable on the phyllode surface. Nerves are commonly faint and/or obscured by hairs or resin and may be misinterpreted as being absent.

### Four

In this state there are four longitudinal nerves running along the length of the phyllode. Taxa with this state often have a quadrangular phyllode cross-section.

### Five

In this state there are five longitudinal nerves running along the length of the phyllode. Among the Victorian _Acacia_ this state is only known in _A. extensa_ and _A. wilhelmiana_.

### Eight

In this state there are eight longitudinal nerves running along the length of the phyllode. Among the Victorian _Acacia_ this state is only known in _A. cineramis_, _A. colletioides_ and _A. sclerophylla_.

### Numerous

In this state there are more than eight longitudinal nerves running along the length of the phyllode.

## Phyllode nerve number (flat or compressed phyllodes)

This character refers to the number of lines (both prominent and minor) that run lengthwise along the surface of mature flat or compressed phyllodes and comprises six states. Nerves are commonly faint or obscured by hairs or resin. The nerves are often more pronounced in dried specimens than in fresh material and consequently this character is often easier to use for dried specimens. The best way to observe nerves in fresh material is to hold a phyllode up to the sky and observe with transmitted light. If phyllodes are terete, sub-terete, quadrangular or pentagonal use the character, Phyllode nerve number (non-flat phyllodes).

### Nerves absent

In this state there are no nerves observable on the phyllode surface. Nerves are commonly faint and/or obscured by hairs or resin and may be misinterpreted as being absent.

### 1 per face

In this state there is a single longitudinal nerve (the midrib) which normally extends the full length of the phyllode. In some multi-nerved phyllodes the central nerve is relatively pronounced and the flanking nerves are obscure. Interpreting such phyllodes as 1 per face will lead to misidentification.

### 2 per face

In this state there are two longitudinal nerves on each face of the phyllode, however, sometimes the second nerve is faint or does not extend the full length of the phyllode.

### 3 per face

In this state there are three longitudinal nerves on each face of the phyllode, however, sometimes the third nerve does not extend the full length of the phyllode.

### 4 per face

In this state there are four longitudinal nerves on each face of the phyllode, however, sometimes the fourth nerve does not extend the full length of the phyllode.

### Numerous per face

In this state there are more than four longitudinal nerves on each face of the phyllode. In some multi-nerved phyllodes the central nerve is relatively pronounced and the flanking nerves are obscure. Interpreting such phyllodes as 1 per face will lead to misidentification.

## Phyllode nerve anastomoses (multi-nerved phyllodes only)

This character refers to the degree in which minor nerves between the main longitudinal nerves branch and rejoin to form a net-like pattern and comprises three states. The nerves are often more pronounced in dried specimens than in fresh material and consequently this character is often easier to use for dried specimens. The best way to observe nerves in fresh material is to hold a phyllode up to the sky and observe with transmitted light.

### Anastomoses numerous

In this state minor nerves between the main longitudinal nerves branch and rejoin frequently to form a net-like pattern (reticulum). Species with terete phyllodes do not have anastomosing nerves.

### Anastomoses few

In this state minor nerves between the main longitudinal nerves mostly stay separated but occasionally rejoin to form elongated, longitudinally orientated nerve-islands, but not an obvious net-like reticulum.

### Anastomoses absent

In this state nerves remain separated from each other and do not rejoin.

## Phyllode apex (pungency)

This character refers to how sharp the tip of the mature phyllodes are and comprises three states.

### Sharply pungent

In this state the tip of the phyllode is gradually or abruptly narrowed to a sharp, rigid, needle-like point that can be painful to press down on.

### Coarsely pungent

In this state the tip of the phyllode is discrete, rigid and hard but is not painful to press down on.

### Apex not pungent

In this state the tips of the phyllodes are soft and pliable or if hard then not at all pungent.

## Phyllode base (decurrence)

This character refers to whether the base of the phyllode continues down the branchlet as a wing or not.

### Continuous with branchlet

In this state the base of the phyllode continues down the branchlet as a wing. Among Victorian _Acacia_ this state is known only in _A. triptera_.

### Not continuous with branchlet

In this state the base of the phyllode is narrowed toward the base to a narrow attachment with the branchlet and no part of the phyllode extends along the branchlet as a wing.

## Pulvinus (presence)

This character refers to whether there is a cushion of tissue at the base of the phyllodes or leaves or not.

### Pulvinus present

In this state there is a cushion of tissue at the base of the phyllodes or leaves that is commonly yellowish and transversely wrinkled, at least when dry.

### Pulvinus absent or very reduced

In this state a cushion of tissue at the base of the phyllodes or leaves that is commonly yellowish and transversely wrinkled, at least when dry, is absent or very rudimentary.

## Gland number (on phyllodes including apex)

For this character, count the total number of glands on a phyllode. Glands (extra-floral nectaries) are usually circular structures located on the upper margin or edge of phyllodes, often near the base. Glands normally have a central orifice surrounded by a rim of yellowish tissue. Sometimes the gland is immersed in the lamina with only the pore showing at the surface (this occurs often on multi-nerved phyllodes). Commonly only one gland is present, however, some species with multiple glands do occur. Occasionally a gland may be located at the base of an apical mucro. It is advisable to inspect more than one phyllode, especially if an absence of glands is suspected. If glands are absent, enter 0.

## Gland distance above pulvinus or base (on phyllodes)

For this character measure precisely in mm the distance from the phyllode end of the pulvinus (or, if the pulvinus is absent, from the base of the phyllode) to the gland.

## Gland at apex of phyllodes

This character refers to whether there is a gland present at the apex of the phyllode or not.

### Apex gland present

In this state there is a gland located at the apex of at least some phyllodes, often at the base of a mucro that may be hooked over the gland.

### Apex gland absent

In this state all phyllodes do not have glands at their apices.

## Petiole length

## Leaflet colour (upper surface)

This character refers to the colour of the upper surface of the leaflets in mature leaves. Leaflet colour is best determined from fresh material. Ignore new shoots which are often differently coloured from mature foliage.

### Leaflet green

This state includes light to dark green and yellow or olive green. If the green is suffused with blue or black then select Grey green to sub-glaucous.

### Leaflet grey green to sub-glaucous

This state is intermediate between green and glaucous.

### Leaflet glaucous

In this state the leaflets have a blue-green or whitish colour resulting from hairs or a bloom on the surface.

## Leaflet colour (lower surface)

This character refers to the colour of the lower surface of the leaflets of mature leaves compared to the upper surface and comprises three states.

## Inflorescence arrangement

This character refers to how the heads of closely packed flowers (inflorescences) are arranged relative to other inflorescences and comprises three states.

### Simple

In this state the heads of closely packed flowers (inflorescences) are borne on a stalk (peduncle) that arises directly from within the angle made by a leaf or phyllode and the stem (axil). Simple inflorescences may be solitary in each axil or multiple simple inflorescences may arise from a single axil.

### Racemose

In this state the heads of closely packed flowers (inflorescences) are borne on a stalk (peduncle) that arises from an unbranched axis that typically bears other inflorescences.

### Paniculate

In this state the heads of closely packed flowers (inflorescences) are borne on a stalk (peduncle) that arises from a branched axis that bears other inflorescences.

## Inflorescence shape

This character refers to the shape of the heads of closely packed flowers (inflorescences) when the flowers are mature with their stamens exserted and comprises three states.

### Globular

In this state the flowers are aggregated into spherical heads.

### Cylindrical

In this state the flowers are aggregated into elongated spikes that are greater than twice as long as wide.

## Inflorescence colour

This character refers to the colour of the flower heads or spikes when the flowers are mature with their stamens exserted. Inflorescence colour is best determined with fresh material.

## Inflorescence flower number (per head)

For this character count the number of flowers in an average size globular head. It is easiest to count flowers when heads are in mature bud before the flowers open. This character is not applicable to species with more elongate inflorescences.

## Raceme length

For this character measure the length in mm of the mature raceme axis from the branch to the base of the uppermost peduncle.

## Raceme basal bracts (or bract scars)

This character refers to whether bracts are produced at the base of a raceme. These are most conspicuous in inflorescence buds where they complete enclose the young heads. These bracts are commonly lost as racemes elongate, however, their presence may be deduced from the bract scars which remain at the extreme base of the raceme axis. Raceme bracts should not be confused with basal peduncular bracts which occur at the base of a peduncle (inflorescence stalk) in many species. Unless raceme bracts are present and conspicuous it is generally best not to use this character. This character is not applicable to specimens with simple or paniculate inflorescences.

### Raceme bracts present

In this state there are bracts or bract scars at the extreme base of the raceme axis.

### Raceme bracts absent

In this state neither bracts or bract scars are present at the extreme base of the raceme axis.

## Peduncle length

This character refers to the length in mm of the stalk of the inflorescence. For species with globular or cylindrical inflorescences in racemes or panicles measure the stalk that branches from the main axis of the raceme or panicle to the head of flowers. If flower heads are sessile (i.e. peduncles are absent) enter 0.

## Peduncle hairs (presence)

This character refers to whether there are hairs on the stalk below the inflorescence or not.

### Peduncle hairs present

In this state there are at least minute or very sparse hairs on the peduncle.

### Peduncle hairs absent

In this state there is a complete absence of hairs on the peduncles.

## Flower merous

This character refers to the number of petals or sepals. This number is typically either four or five.

## Sepal fusion

This character refers to the degree to which the outer most series of flower parts (sepals) fuse with the adjacent sepals. Due to the small size of the flowers a microscope may be required to accurately use this character.

### Free to base

In this state adjacent sepals are completely free from each other.

### Very shortly united

In this state the sepals are fused with adjacent sepals for up to around ¼ of their length.

### Clearly united

In this state the sepals are united for more than ¼ of their length. The calyx can be shallowly or deeply lobed, or truncate.

## Pod width

For this character measure the width in mm of the widest point across a mature pod.

## Pod curvature

This character refers to the nature or curving of undehisced, mature pods.

### Straight

In this state the pod is without a curve, bend or angle.

### Slightly curved

In this state the pod is continuously bent into a shallow arc.

### Curved

In this state the pod is continuously bent into an obvious arc.

### Twisted

In this state the pod is wavy.

## Pod hairs

This character refers to whether there are hairs on mature pods or not. Avoid using immature or very old pods.

### Pod hairs present

In this state there are some hairs on some part of the pod. The hairs can be minute and very sparse.

### Pod hairs absent

In this state there is a complete absence of hairs on the pod.

## Seed orientation (in pods)

This character refers to how the seeds are orientated in the pod and comprises three states. Seed orientation is best determined using pods that have not yet dehisced. After dehiscence the orientation of the seeds can easily become altered. The actual seeds can be observed to determine this feature or orientation can sometimes be determined indirectly in undehisced pods by observing the shape of the swelling over the seed.

### Longitudinal

In this state the long axis of the seed is more or less parallel to the long axis of the pod. For globose seeds the long axis is regarded as a line from the hilum through the centre of the areole.

### Oblique

In this state the long axis of the seed is inclined at about 30 to 60 degrees to the long axis of the pod.

### Transverse

In this state the long axis of the seed is more or less at right angles to the long axis of the pod.

## Funicle

This character refers to whether or not the cord that attaches the seed to the pod (funicle) extends in a complete or partial ring around the seed.

### Half or more encircling the seed

In this state the funicle is long and forms partial to many rings around the seed.

### Not encircling the seed

In this state the funicle is short and does not extend more than halfway around the seed before attaching to the pod.

## Aril development

This character refers to the extent to which the cord that connects the seed to the pod (funicle) is enlarged at the seed-attachment end to form an aril. The funicle may be gradually or abruptly expanded into the aril. In the former case there is often no morphological discontinuity between the two structures.

### Well developed

In this state the funicle gradually or abruptly expands into an obvious aril.

### Poorly developed

In this state the funicle is slightly expanded into a very small aril.

### Aril absent

In this state the funicle is a slender thread that is not at all expanded at the seed-attachment end.

## Occurrence

Victoria has been divided into 16 natural regions. For this character the user determines which natural region the plant that is to be identified was found in to enter for this character. Whether a taxon is regarded as occurring in a particular natural region or not is dependent on whether the taxon has been previously documented as occurring in that natural region or not. There is a remote possible that a taxon occurs in a natural region but has not yet been documented in that natural region. In such a case the key will not recognise that taxon as occurring in that natural region which will result in a misidentification for the user. This issue may be particularly relevant to newly introduced species which may be still expanding their range through Victoria or for taxa that are not collected often. Due to these issues we suggest that this character be one of the first characters investigated as a potential reason for misidentification.
