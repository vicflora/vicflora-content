### Plant Identifications

The VicFlora Team is unable to provide plant identifications. Accordingly, we ask that you do not use the email address above for identifications requests as these requests will not be processed. Royal Botanic Gardens Victoria does offer a <a href="https://www.rbg.vic.gov.au/science/identifications/">Plant Identifications service</a>, and details about this service are detailed on that webpage.
