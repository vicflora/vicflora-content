title: Checklists
---
VicFlora allows you to generate your own species checklists for Victorian _Parks and Reserves_, _Bioregions_, _Local Government Areas_, and by _Registered Aboriginal Party_ boundary areas. To do this, simply select one of the four options to update the map with the correct layer. Next, click on the map in the area you are trying to generate a checklist for. The results will then be displayed automatically below the map. You can then either filter the results further, or download the list in .CSV format by clicking the Download button.

For further guidance, please refer to our [short video tutorial on checklist generation](https://youtu.be/VoQZEwWi5U8), using the Registered Aboriginal Party regions layer as an example.
