For those users who have had problems with navigating between pages of search 
results, you were not the only ones. The problem was<!--more--> that the pagination 
performed differently in different browsers and it worked perfectly fine on my 
laptop and on my phone. Therefore, it took a bit of time to track down what the 
problem exactly was.

I have now replaced the pagination, which is on the Search and Checklists pages, 
with something else. The new paginator is a bit simpler, so there is less chance 
of things interfering with each other (which I think was what was happening 
before), so I hope this resolves the problems people have been having. Apologies 
for the inconvenience so far.
