VicFlora has been re-launched today, featuring a new open-source core that has allowed us to add new usability and accessibility features that will improve the user experience for both casual users and experienced botanists alike, and allow us to make further improvements more easily. Features at the time of re-launch include<!--more-->: 

-	An updated distribution map platform based on an open-source, mobile-friendly interface. The new map includes display of AVH (Australian Virtual Herbarium) record data for map points, as well as layer functionality that allows users to overlay Bioregions, Local Government Areas, and Parks and Reserves
-	Improved checklist functionality, allowing the creation of species checklists for Bioregions, Local Government Areas, and Parks and Reserves
-	Taxon profiles with enhanced links to APNI (Australian Plant Names Index) and links to species profiles in sister floras in Australia and New Zealand
-	Definitions of the ‘status fields’ in taxon profiles are now provided in pop-up boxes simply accessed by hovering over the text in question
-	A glossary of botanical terminology that is accessible from all individual species entries, highlighting technical terms with definitions provided on hover. Definitions are also now accessible from directly within our keys to the main groups of vascular plants in Victoria
-	An updated ‘threat status’ field to include IUCN, FFG, EPBC status
-	Establishment means and degree of establishment values have been mapped to the new Darwin Core vocabularies to standardise the vocabulary used for communicating information about biodiversity
-	Multi-access (Matrix) keys are available for Victorian Acacia, Asteraceae, Cyperaceae, Eucalypts, Fabaceae, Juncaceae and Flowering Plant Families
-	Updated APIs (Application Programming Interface), allowing other systems and apps to make use of our data more easily

Exciting new features not ready at the time of re-launch are also in development. These will further improve access to valuable data and offer users an even more useful set of tools.

First launched in September 2016, VicFlora provides identification tools and information on all known native and naturalised Victorian plants, totalling over 4,400 different plant entries. Today, VicFlora contains over 33,000 images that document 80 % of Victoria's plants, a figure which increases each season. It is the organisation's most used scientific resource, with 189,000 users and over 2.1M pages of data delivered per year, and 1,600 users per day during the peak flowering season (2022 data).

As such, VicFlora is one of the most visited sites in Australia for native plant identification. Significant milestones were attained in 2020 and 2021 when Eucalyptus and Acacia ‘exemplars’ were respectively added to the flora. Exemplars are very high-resolution images of perfect reference specimens, in this case covering Victoria’s many Eucalyptus and Acacia species, including close-ups of key diagnostic characters.  

Through our continual development of VicFlora, we will ensure that the platform remains the primary port of call for all those seeking to identify the plants of Victoria, as well as the authoritative reference for natural resource managers and secondary and tertiary students in the natural sciences.
