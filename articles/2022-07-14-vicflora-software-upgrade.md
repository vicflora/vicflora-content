Today we are releasing a major upgrade of VicFlora, with completely new 
underlying infrastructure and a fresh new look that aligns with the Royal 
Botanic Gardens Victoria (RBGV) visuals.<!--more-->

While this upgrade is about the infrastructure behind VicFlora, a number of new 
features and improvements that we hope will enhance the experience of VicFlora 
users already ship with this release.

- Acting on feedback from users we have made the distribution maps interactive, 
    so users can now zoom in and out on the maps, interrogate points and link to 
    the underlying occurrence records in the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA), 
    and add overlays with Victorian Bioregions, Local Government Areas (LGAs) 
    or Parks and Conservation Reserves and get information about the occurrence 
    status, origin and degree of establishment of a species or infraspecific 
    taxon in those areas. We have also replaced the static state distribution 
    maps with interactive map with distribution data from the Australasian 
    Virtual Herbarium (AVH).

    Due to performance enhancements in our data processing, we are now also able 
    to get updated occurrence data from ALA every week.

- Checklist functionality has improved. One can now make checklists for areas in 
    all the same spatial layers that can be overlayed on the maps (see above). 
    These areas are indexed against the taxa in VicFlora, so the checklist 
    appears almost instantly when an area is selected. As checklists are now 
    essentially search results, the can be filtered on the same facets and have 
    the same download options as search results.

- We now have links from the taxon pages to treatments of the taxon in the Flora 
    of Australia, all state and territory floras and the Flora of New Zealand, 
    in so far as those are available online. There is also processing in place 
    to update these links periodically, so they remain up-to-date with changes 
    in those other floras.

- We are working on increased collaboration and interlinking between VicFlora 
    and the Victorian Biodiversity Atlas (VBA). Currently this is expressed by 
    the threat status values according to the Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act 1988 
    (FFG; Victoria) and the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation 
    Act 1999 (EPBC; Australia) in VicFlora coming from the VBA. The FFG values 
    are reasonably new and were obtained by assessment of taxa that occur in 
    Victoria against International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) 
    criteria, a process in which VicFlora editors were heavily involved. 
    For taxa that have not been assessed yet, we still provide the old Victorian 
    Advisory List values.

- We have mapped our establishment means values against the new Darwin Core 
    vocabularies for Establishment Means and Degree of Establishment. The big 
    advantage of using these standard terms is that they mean the same 
    everywhere, making data from different resources more readily comparable 
    and thus more vocabulary, and making the terms more easily understood by 
    overseas users who might not be familiar with the Victorian or Australian 
    context. As the terms we use now might not be familiar to VicFlora users, 
    we provide their definitions in popovers, which can be made visible by 
    hovering over the text. We have extended this functionality to the other 
    "status" terms as well.

- It is now possible to have technical terms used in the descriptions looked up 
    in the glossary by simply clicking a button. Terms that can be found in the 
    glossary will show up as links in the description and their definition is 
    shown in a popover when one hovers the mouse over a link. The same 
    functionality is available for the leads in the (pathway) identification 
    keys.

- Last but not least, as this is actually infrastructure, VicFlora is now 
    entirely service-based and all data in VicFlora is available through an 
    Application Programmer Interface (API), which means that developers can use 
    data from VicFlora in their own applications. VicFlora itself uses this API, 
    so other applications can access the same up-to-date data VicFlora is 
    showing.

Through our continual development of VicFlora, we will ensure that the platform 
remains the primary port of call for all those seeking to identify the plants of 
Victoria, as well as the authoritative reference for natural resource managers 
and secondary and tertiary students in the natural sciences.
