  VicFlora is a comprehensive and current guide to the wild plants of Victoria.
  The species profiles and identification tools that make up this richly
  illustrated resource are provided by Royal Botanic Gardens Victoria free of
  charge for use by land managers, scientists, students and anyone else with an
  interest in the Victorian flora. The platform currently provides resources for
  vascular plants (including seed plants and ferns) and bryophytes (mosses,
  liverworts and hornworts).
